# Airlines-Delay-project
Flight delays across three of the principal international airports in New York.
The three airports being JFK, EWR and LGA.
There are many carriers that fly in and out of these three airports daily.
This project is about gaining business insights around these delays and possible action that could be taken.
The coding has been done in Python.
